# Bildertisch

Bildertisch (drawCanvas.exe) is a tool written out of the need for a simple tool, that yet did not exist on the net

When working with photo images I often work with combinations of 3,4 or many pictures. Look up the gallery hangings of Wolfgang Tillmanns, Anders Petersen or Michael Schmid to get an impression, how the combination of image can be used in an artistic way.

Instead of using GIMP or any image manipulation programm I wrote my own app... since I did not find any app on the net that was able to fullfil my needs for a simple, intuitive tool.

So, without any documentation, Bildertisch is a bit unfinished, though the code is in productive use since 2017. It's win32 only, as some of the packages are precompiled binaries and rely on win only dlls. Sorry, but it runs fine under WINE!

I'll maybe writeup some dok in the futur if and when I find the time...
